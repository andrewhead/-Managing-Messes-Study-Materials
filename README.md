# Study materials for "Managing Messes in Computational Notebooks"

This repository includes materials for running the usability
study for the technical paper, "Managing Messes in
Computational Notebooks".

Tutorial documents, task instructions, study guides, and
questionnaires can be found as the `.docx` files in the main
directory of this repository.

The notebooks participants used in notebook cleaning and
exploratory data analysis tasks can be found in the
`notebooks` directory.

## Setting up the notebooks

These notebooks were last executed with a Python 3.6.6
kernel. To run all of the notebooks, you will need to
install all of the dependency packages listed in the
`requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you haven't already, you will need to install Jupyter
notebook or Jupyter Lab to open the notebooks (e.g., `pip
install jupyterlab`). To download code gathering tools for
the notebooks, see instructions on the
[the code gathering tools
webpage](https://microsoft.github.io/gather).
